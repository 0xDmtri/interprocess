/// Local socket server, listening for connections.

/// # Name reclamation
/// *This section only applies to Unix domain sockets.*
///
/// When a Unix domain socket listener is closed, its associated socket file is not automatically
/// deleted. Instead, it remains on the filesystem in a zombie state, neither accepting connections
/// nor allowing a new listener to reuse it â€“ [`create_sync()`] will return
/// [`AddrInUse`](io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse) unless it is deleted manually.
///
/// Interprocess implements *automatic name reclamation* via: when the local socket listener is
/// dropped, it performs [`std::fs::remove_file()`] (i.e. `unlink()`) with the path that was
/// originally passed to [`create_sync()`], allowing for subsequent reuse of the local socket name.
///
/// If the program crashes in a way that doesn't unwind the stack, the deletion will not occur and
/// the socket file will linger on the filesystem, in which case manual deletion will be necessary.
/// Identially, the automatic name reclamation mechanism can be opted out of via
/// [`.do_not_reclaim_name_on_drop()`](trait::Listener::do_not_reclaim_name_on_drop) on the listener
/// or [`.reclaim_name(false)`](super::options::ListenerOptions::reclaim_name) on the builder.
///
/// Note that the socket file can be unlinked by other programs at any time, retaining the inode the
/// listener is bound to but making it inaccessible to peers if it was at its last hardlink. If that
/// happens and another listener takes the same path before the first one performs name reclamation,
/// the socket file deletion wouldn't correspond to the listener being closed, instead deleting the
/// socket file of the second listener. If the second listener also performs name reclamation, the
/// ensuing deletion will silently fail. Due to the awful design of Unix, this issue cannot be
/// mitigated.

/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic server
/// ```no_run
/// use interprocess::local_socket::{
/// 	prelude::*,
/// 	Listener, ListenerOptions, Stream,
/// 	GenericFilePath, GenericNamespaced,
/// };
/// use std::io::{self, prelude::*, BufReader};
///
/// // Define a function that checks for errors in incoming connections. We'll use this to filter
/// // through connections that fail on initialization for one reason or another.
/// fn handle_error(conn: io::Result<Stream>) -> Option<Stream> {
/// 	match conn {
/// 		Ok(c) => Some(c),
/// 		Err(e) => {
/// 			eprintln!("Incoming connection failed: {e}");
/// 			None
/// 		}
/// 	}
/// }
///
/// // Pick a name.
/// let printname = "example.sock";
/// let name = printname.to_ns_name::<GenericNamespaced>()?;
///
/// // Configure our listener...
/// let opts = ListenerOptions::new()
/// 	.name(name);
///
/// // ...then create it.
/// let listener = match opts.create_sync() {
/// 	Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse => {
/// 		// When a program that uses a file-type socket name terminates its socket server without
/// 		// deleting the file, a "corpse socket" remains, which can neither be connected to nor
/// 		// reused by a new listener. Normally, Interprocess takes care of this on affected
/// 		// platforms by deleting the socket file when the listener is dropped. (This is
/// 		// vulnerable to all sorts of races and thus can be disabled.)
/// 		//
/// 		// There are multiple ways this error can be handled, if it occurs, but when the
/// 		// listener only comes from Interprocess, it can be assumed that its previous instance
/// 		// either has crashed or simply hasn't exited yet. In this example, we leave cleanup up
/// 		// to the user, but in a real application, you usually don't want to do that.
/// 		eprintln!(
/// 			"
///Error: could not start server because the socket file is occupied. Please check if {printname}
///is in use by another process and try again."
/// 		);
/// 		return Err(e.into());
/// 	}
/// 	x => x?,
/// };
///
/// // The syncronization between the server and client, if any is used, goes here.
/// eprintln!("Server running at {printname}");
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving at a later moment. This size should be
/// // enough and should be easy to find for the allocator. Since we only have one concurrent
/// // client, there's no need to reallocate the buffer repeatedly.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// for conn in listener.incoming().filter_map(handle_error) {
/// 	// Wrap the connection into a buffered receiver right away
/// 	// so that we could receive a single line from it.
/// 	let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
/// 	println!("Incoming connection!");
///
/// 	// Since our client example sends first, the server should receive a line and only then
/// 	// send a response. Otherwise, because receiving from and sending to a connection cannot be
/// 	// simultaneous without threads or async, we can deadlock the two processes by having both
/// 	// sides wait for the send buffer to be emptied by the other.
/// 	conn.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
/// 	// Now that the receive has come through and the client is waiting on the server's send, do

/// 	// `Write`.)
