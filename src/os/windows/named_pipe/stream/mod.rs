/// A named pipe stream, created by a server-side listener or by connecting to a server.
///
/// This type combines in itself all possible combinations of receive modes and send modes, plugged into it using the `Rm` and `Sm` generic parameters respectively.
///
/// Pipe streams can be split by reference and by value for concurrent receive and send operations. Splitting by reference is ephemeral and can be achieved by simply borrowing the stream, since both `PipeStream` and `&PipeStream` implement I/O traits. Splitting by value is done using the [`.split()`](Self::split) method, producing a [`RecvHalf`] and a [`SendHalf`], and can be reverted via the `.reunite()` method defined on the halves.

/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic bytestream client
/// ```no_run
/// use interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe::*;
/// use std::io::{BufReader, prelude::*};
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for reading.
/// // This size should be enough and should be easy to find for the allocator.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// // Create our connection. This will block until the server accepts our connection, but will fail
/// // immediately if the server hasn't even started yet; somewhat similar to how happens with TCP,
/// // where connecting to a port that's not bound to any server will send a "connection refused"
/// // response, but that will take twice the ping, the roundtrip time, to reach the client.
/// let conn = DuplexPipeStream::<pipe_mode::Bytes>::connect("Example")?;
/// // Wrap it into a buffered reader right away so that we could read a single line out of it.
/// let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
///
/// // Write our message into the stream. This will finish either when the whole message has been
/// // writen or if a write operation returns an error. (`.get_mut()` is to get the writer,
/// // `BufReader` doesn't implement a pass-through `Write`.)
/// conn.get_mut().write_all(b"Hello from client!\n")?;
///
/// // We now employ the buffer we allocated prior and read a single line, interpreting a newline
/// // character as an end-of-file (because local sockets cannot be portably shut down), verifying
/// // validity of UTF-8 on the fly.
/// conn.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
/// // Print out the result, getting the newline for free!
/// print!("Server answered: {buffer}");
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())

///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for reading. Keep in mind that this will depend on
/// // the specifics of the protocol you're using.
/// let mut buffer = Vec::<u8>::with_capacity(128);

/// let sent = conn.send(MESSAGE)?;
/// assert_eq!(sent, MESSAGE.len()); // If it doesn't match, something's seriously wrong.
