/// For this to work, you need [`DuplicateHandle`](windows_sys::Win32::Foundation::DuplicateHandle) â€“ the Win32 API function
/// which duplicates a handle into the handle table of the specified process (the receiver is referred to by its
/// handle). This trait exposes the `DuplicateHandle` functionality in a safe manner.
///
/// Note that the resulting handle is expected not to be inheritable. It is a logic error to have the output of
/// `.share()` to be inheritable, but it is not UB.
