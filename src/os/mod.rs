//! Platform-specific functionality for various interprocess communication primitives.
//!
//! This module houses two modules: [`unix`] and [`windows`]. Depending on your platform, one of those is available, so if you only see one module here, don't worry â€” it's just not available for the platform on which you're browsing the docs. If you're using [`docs.rs`], you can see the documentation for other platforms using the navigation bar on the top of the page.
